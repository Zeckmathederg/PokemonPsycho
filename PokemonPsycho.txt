	I am Dinsdale, number 26. I work at the high-end rescue guild at Treasure City,
at the turning of the forever paralysis of time. This is what being Dinsdale means to me.

	We were riding the local pelicab: cheap as stones and only angered my co-worker
more. "Why did he of all people take my job letter? At least that one had a modest price
on it, unlike all the other low-paying jobs," Muttski loudly questioned to me and rather
more fitting, himself. "And what of this terrible service that we agreed to use? Why did
you let me agree to this, Dinsdale?" I was now on the verge of blurting out what I thought,
but that would breaken my abstraction, and I could no longer fit in. "Whatever. There was
nothing else, as all the other services were reserved." The Pelliper named James, number
31, did not look back at our on-goings and kept flying. I pulled out my Loudible 3120T
Portable Tape Player and listened to Kelpy G's "Jam out, Real Jazz" newly released album while
Muttski went on, which embarassed me.
